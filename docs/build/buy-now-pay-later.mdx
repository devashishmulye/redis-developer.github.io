## Introduction to Buy-Now, Pay-Later

FinBox allows you to offer buy-now, pay-later (BNPL) at checkout within your platform. It is a short-term financing option that addresses MSMEsâ€™ liquidity crunch, allowing them to purchase now and pay for it in installments later. 

FinBox activates a credit line for your customers to avail of BNPL and manages the lending journey end-to-end. Plugging BNPL into your platform can help improve a number of business metrics like AOV, GMV and CLTV.
