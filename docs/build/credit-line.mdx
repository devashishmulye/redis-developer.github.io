## Introduction to Credit Line

A steady stream of funds is better than a number of loans for different purposes. With FinBox, offer a recurring and embeddable credit line -  a loan product for which customers must apply only once. 

They can withdraw money instantly as demand arises and repay in a flexible manner over a tenure and at an interest rate of their choice. We charge interest only on the amount actually withdrawn and replenish the credit line with the payment of each installment.


## About Credit Line

With the FinBox Credit Line, you can build - 
* Closed Loop Credit Line (The money is directly disbursed to you rather than end-customer. See B2B-E-Commerce BNPL)
* Open Look (Loan is disbursed to the borrower)

* The Credit Line is approved instantly.
* Credit Line is activated in 1-2 working days
* The credit line can be offered as a [BNPL option](/build/buy-now-pay-later-overdraft) or a revolving line of credit for working capital needs.
* All subsequent transactions from the credit line are instant.
* The Credit Line is valid for 1 year.
* We support multiple [repayment models](/nomenclature#repayment), based on your target demographic.
* Each transaction is a bullet loan (i.e the repayment should be done all at once)
* The [repayment tenure](/nomenclature#repayment) is flexible.
