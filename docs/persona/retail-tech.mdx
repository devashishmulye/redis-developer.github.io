Retail tech platforms can use Embedded Finance Infrastructure to offer credit products like working capital loans and salary advances to their MSME customers. Platforms can use data available with themselves to underwrite their customers. The end-to-end loan journey is enabled by our infrastructure.

## Why you need Embedded Finance on your retail tech platform

* **Alternative data underwriting** - We use data from your own platform to underwrite your customers. For example, customers’ cash flows and accounts receivable can be used to determine the loan amount to be sanctioned.

* **Customer retention** - Small businesses on retail-tech platforms may often run into cash flow problems. You can offer them small-ticket loans within the app itself to tide over emergencies. This enhanced experience will translate to enhanced customer retention.

* **Tailored credit products** - Offer loans to customers at the point of demand creation. Based on their needs, you can offer working capital loans, salary advances, accounts receivable financing and invoice financing. Unlike traditional credit, these products are in-context and flexible.

* **Instant approval and disbursal** - Automated underwriting based on platform data ensures that approvals are instant. Once the customer completes their formalities, the disbursement also happens instantly.

* **Approve new-to-credit customers** - Loans are underwritten based on platform data. This helps disburse loans to customers with inadequate credit scores from traditional bureaus. 

## Credit Products you can offer 

Retail tech platforms can offer a number of credit products with Embedded Finance Infrastructure based on the type of data they possess.

* **[Working capital loans](/build/working-capital)** - Small-ticket loans that allow your customers to carry out everyday operations in the short run. You can lend up to Rs 5 lakh over a tenure of up to 6 months. These are collateral-free credit products that can be disbursed in just 24-48 hours.

* **Accounts receivable loans** - Offer loans against the accounts receivables of the businesses on your platform. We underwrite your customers with precision based on the accounts data available with your platform.

* **[Salary advances](/build/salary-advance)** - Users can get a portion of their salary in advance as a loan from their employers. Once the manager approves the loan, the amount is disbursed to the employee’s bank account. The repayment occurs as auto-debit of the EMIs from their subsequent salaries.

* **Grow revenue** - Embedded Finance unlocks usage-based revenue models that can help retail-tech platforms increase their revenue by 5x.
 
* **Capture market share faster** - Reduce the cost of your main offering with usage-based revenue and build a captive user base faster.
