##  The challenge

The credit gap for MSMEs in India is $380 Billion.  

MSMEs are already onboarded on digital platforms/commerce portals and generate a lot of data on/off the platforms. This data can be used to underwrite them. Despite being a high-quality borrower pool, they have low access to credit. This is because they lack 
formal data that financial institutions understand. In addition, they often operate informally, require small and flexible credit, which financial instutitions can't offer.


This is the problem that FinBox solves. The key to winning in MSME credit is in-context, tailored credit with partnerships and using alternate data to underwrite borrowers with GST, transactions on the platform, cash flows etc.

## Building blocks


- [**Customer Onboarding**](/block/customer-onboarding)  - Customer onboarding involves loan application, submission of relevant documents and their verification. Digital lending replicates and optimizes the manual onboarding process for higher speed and accuracy in verification.
- [**Risk Assessment**](/block/risk) - Credit risk assessment involves underwriting borrowers’ ability to repay loans. Traditional lenders analyze credit scores available with credit bureaus. In digital lending, tools of risk assessment include alternate data such as cash flows and spending habits. The terms of the loan are decided based on credit risk assessment.
- [**Capital**](block/capital) - The bank’s monetary resources disbursed as loans to borrowers. 
- [**Loan Management**](block/loan-management) - Loan management systems/software (LMS) enable the complete automation of the loan pipeline - from application to repayment. Effective loan management processes customer information with speed and accuracy. It makes all lending operations smooth. 
- [**Collections**](block/collections) - The process of eliciting loan repayment from customers. Legacy banks use debt collection agencies to recover loans from borrowers. Digital lenders can streamline their collections by using data around credit utilization and spending habits during the loan lifecycle.
- [**Reconciliation**](block/reconciliation) - Lenders cross-check financial records and track loans repayments received, not received and the total number of files through the reconciliation process. It helps lenders keep tabs on the status of their total loan books.
