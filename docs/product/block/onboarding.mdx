FinBox provides adaptive journeys to onboard customers onto a credit product. 


## Customer onboarding

- We show banners in the anchor app.
- Via marketing campaign

Customers who are in need of loan are onboarded via our anchor apps. We ask for thier bank statements and device data to check thier credit history and eligibility. We underwrite alternate data to analyse the risks involved. Lenders use this data to provide credit.


## Application Process

* We ask users for their bank details, PAN card, phone number and other personal details. 
* We fetch credit score from bureau
* We collect alternative data using our product DeviceConnect, which is used for underwriting.
* Anchor apps give thier Platform Data 
* We ask user to upload Bank Statement using our product BankConnect 

However the journey is adaptive, so we only collect as much as we need.

## Adaptive Journey 

We show him a eligibility screen

<CenteredImage  imgSrc={"/img/eligibility-screen.png" } text="Linking Bank Account" imgWidth="35%"/>

Then User completes

- eKYC
- eNACH
- PennyDrop
- eSign

User is shown an offer.


## Assisted Journey

* In assisted journey we autofill all the data required for loan application using the platform data that our partner has shared with us.
* Then we send a link to user to complete eKYC and accept the loan offer by digitally signing the agreement.
