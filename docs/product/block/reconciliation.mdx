Repayment can be done within 15 days from the date of withdrawal. Users can repay their EMI before their due date as well.
## Reconciliation or EMI Repayments can be done in 3 ways:

** 1. App Payment(via FinBox payment gateway)**

Users pay via our payment gateway. Money is transferred to FinBoxâ€™s account and then we transfer it to the respective lenders.

** 2. Via eNACH(Digio aur Cashfree)**

eNACH is activated on the due date. In the case of Cashfree money is paid to FinBox then transferred to the lenders. In the case of Digio, money is directly transferred to the respective lenders. We only notify the lenders about repayment.


** 3. Bank Payment **

A virtual Bank Account is created and the user can transfer money to this account. This is done to avoid the confusion created by multiple repayment deadlines( If the user withdraws money from the credit line on consecutive 5 days, then the repayment deadline will be on consecutive 5 days so to avoid that this virtual bank account is created).
