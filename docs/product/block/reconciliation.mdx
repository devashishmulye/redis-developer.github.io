## What is the reconciliation process?

The reconciliation process helps lenders check multiple sets of financial records to tally figures to check if they are correct. Through loan reconciliation, credit product data like the total files, those received and those not received is tracked so that lenders can keep a record of the status of all their loans. 


## What is the importance of the reconciliation process?

The loan reconciliation process is crucial as it helps lenders streamline their loan books. Since banks and NBFCs disburse loans in large amounts, it can be challenging to keep track of each credit product. Reconciliation processes help lenders get accurate information about credit ownership.

## How do financial institutions do reconciliation?

Here’s how financial institutions conduct loan reconciliation--

* Gather data from a variety of sources
* Categorize different loans based on their type
* Compute the number of loans in each category
* Recognize the status of all these loans
* Analyze the status of each loan
* Summarize the reconciliation findings in a report

Loan reconciliation can be automated to streamline the entire process. This helps store and source the data all in one place, eliminating the segregation into various categories.

Repayment can be done within 15 days from the date of withdrawal. Users can repay their EMI before their due date as well.
## Reconciliation or EMI Repayments can be done in 3 ways:

* **App Payment(via FinBox payment gateway)** - Users pay via our payment gateway. Money is transferred to FinBox’s account and then we transfer it to the respective lenders.

* **Via eNACH(Digio aur Cashfree)** - eNACH is activated on the due date. In the case of Cashfree money is paid to FinBox then transferred to the lenders. In the case of Digio, money is directly transferred to the respective lenders. We only notify the lenders about repayment.


* **Bank Payment ** - A virtual Bank Account is created and the user can transfer money to this account. This is done to avoid the confusion created by multiple repayment deadlines( If the user withdraws money from the credit line on consecutive 5 days, then the repayment deadline will be on consecutive 5 days so to avoid that this virtual bank account is created).
