At its core, lending is how well you manage and assess risk. Good risk assessment not only helps you collect debt, it helps you approve more customers, improves your margin, and enables you to improve the terms of credit for your end user.

When lenders underwrite a customer, they assess him along two parameters - 

### Capability to Pay

We analyse users bank statement and look for his income, and other credit history. Based on thse we detemine users' capability to pay.

### Inent to Pay

We look for users engagement on Anchor app and previous repayment history. Based on this we detemine users intent to pay.

## Two ways of assessing credit-worthiness

### Tradition Underwriting (Credit History Driven)

Bureau score for underwiting.

### Alternate Data Underwriting

Our products [DeviceConnect](/product/products/device-connect) and [BankConnect](/product/products/bank-connect) provides us the alternate data to underwrite.

Lenders have a rule engine - explain what a rule engine is what part it plays


## FinBox Alternate data Underwriting suite:

* [DeviceConnect](/product/products/device-connect)
* [BankConnect](/product/products/bank-connect)

## How we Credit Score NTC Customers

For NTC(New to credit) users we use alternate data for underwriting. We get alternate data using device connect and also from partners.
Our Alternative data-based underwriting scorecards from mobile device data enable us to approve New-to-Credit customers.

## Risk based pricing

A credit limit is set for users based on their credit history, bureau score, and credit score. We do not live large ticket loans to users with low credit score.

## Fraud Management

DeviceConnect helps lenders identify fraudulent applications earlier in the loan cycle, thereby optimizing the loan funnel and equalizing interest rates, i.e., lower interest rates for good borrowers and higher for high-risk ones.
