## What is an LMS?

A loan management system (LMS) is a software that automates the entire loan lifecycle or parts of it. It helps streamline lending workflows that are becoming increasingly complex. A typical LMS can automate loan origination, servicing and collections. 

It also processes customer information and produces more accurate statements and reports. It is equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) analytics. Unlike legacy systems, loan management software delivers accurate results quickly.

## What features should an LMS have?

A good LMS should comprise of the following features --

* **Integratable** - An LMS should come with different modules for onboarding, credit assessment, loan servicing, underwriting and collections. It should also be conducive to third-party integrations like accounting software, ERPs and CMS.

* **Scalability** - A scalable LMS can help businesses start small and slowly expand usage as they grow. It would help operations grow, provide good services and offer diverse credit products. A good LMS offers agility in entering new markets.

* **Deployment & support** - A cloud-based LMS is easy to deploy and maintain. Since an LMS stores a lot of user data, round-the-clock tech support becomes critical. These systems offer upgrades, fixes and comprehensive maintenance.

* **Transparent, friendly interface** - LMS software should support intuitive mobile phone usage. The entire loan process should also be transparent. Automated dashboards with notification for every step of the way are invaluable in improving user experience. 

* **Security** - The ideal LMS would make the exchange of data seamless and easy while also abiding by the prevalent privacy and data security standards. 
What is the importance of an LMS?

* **Save time**: Automatic verification of customers, calculation of the loan structure, tenure and terms and standardized decisioning rules enable a quicker turnaround time.

* **Transparency** : Lenders can track documents and customers can keep track of the stages of the process on the LMS. 

* **Accuracy** : No room for computational error as human involvement is eliminated by using an LMS.
