Digital platforms can embed financing solutions for their customers within their app itself. FinBox’s Embedded Finance Infrastructure is designed to perform all lending workflows - onboarding customers, the loan journey, partnering with lenders, integrating with third parties, performing risk assessment, and collecting repayments.

## Why you need Embedded Finance on your digital platform

* ***Enhance user experience*** Users are given financing options at the time of checkout. These are embedded into the app itself so that they do not have to leave the platform at the time of payment.

* ***End-to-end services*** Get everything required to become a lender without taking any of the responsibility. We take care of integrations like KYC and compliance measures. Our partner-lenders bring the licenses and capital.

* ***High-precision underwriting*** Lend to trustworthy customers. We perform credit assessment based on billions of data points and use artificial intelligence and machine learning models for precision.

* ***Collection prioritization system*** We use real-time cash flow insights to understand customers’ credit utilization and spending habits. This helps us catch possibilities for default and delinquency very early.

* ***Easy integration*** Our Embedded Finance Infrastructure, along with various customization options, can be easily integrated into your platform. You can go live with our Embedded Finance Infrastructure in just 7 days.

* ***Unlock new revenue streams*** Earn commissions on each loan disbursed on your platform. Leverage platform data to up sell and cross sell loans.

* ***Offer flexible repayment*** Allow customers to repay their loans in installments or bullet payments. The tenure of loans is also flexible. 

## How it works

Here’s how the process of offering credit on platforms through Embedded Finance works -

* ***Loan widget is embedded***: Our SDK embeds a loan widget in the platform displaying the credit products on offer.

* ***Underwriting***: The risk engine piece of our Embedded Finance Infrastructure automatically assesses customers’ credit risk. Pre-qualified customers are shown a loan application banner.

* ***Application***: Customers complete the entire loan journey within the app itself.

* ***Approval***:  The loan is approved in real time for eligible customers.

* ***Disbursal***: The loan amount is disbursed to the customer’s bank account.
