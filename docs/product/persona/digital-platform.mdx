Digital platforms can embed financing solutions for their customers within their app itself. FinBox’s Embedded Finance Infrastructure is designed to perform all lending workflows - onboarding customers, the loan journey, partnering with lenders, integrating with third parties, performing risk assessment, and collecting repayments.

## Why you need Embedded Finance on your digital platform

* **Enhance user experience** - Users are given financing options at the time of checkout. These are embedded into the app itself so that they do not have to leave the platform at the time of payment.

* **End-to-end services** - Get everything required to become a lender without taking any of the responsibility. We take care of integrations like KYC and compliance measures. Our partner-lenders bring the licenses and capital.

* **High-precision underwriting** - Lend to trustworthy customers. We perform credit assessment based on billions of data points and use artificial intelligence and machine learning models for precision.

* **Collection prioritization system** - We use real-time cash flow insights to understand customers’ credit utilization and spending habits. This helps us catch possibilities for default and delinquency very early.

* **Easy integration** - Our Embedded Finance Infrastructure, along with various customization options, can be easily integrated into your platform. You can go live with our Embedded Finance Infrastructure in just 7 days.

* **Unlock new revenue streams** - Earn commissions on each loan disbursed on your platform. Leverage platform data to up sell and cross sell loans.

## Loans you can offer 

Digital platforms can offer a number of credit products with Embedded Finance Infrastructure based on the type of data they possess.

* **Working capital loans** - Small-ticket loans that allow your customers to carry out everyday operations in the short run. You can lend up to Rs 5 lakh over a tenure of up to 6 months. These are collateral-free credit products that can be disbursed in just 24-48 hours.

* **Accounts receivable loans** - Offer loans against the accounts receivables of the businesses on your platform. We underwrite your customers with precision based on the accounts data available with your platform.

* **Salary advances** - Users can get a portion of their salary in advance as a loan from their employers. Once the manager approves the loan, the amount is disbursed to the employee’s bank account. The repayment occurs as auto-debit of the EMIs from their subsequent salaries.

## Impact

* **Higher AOV** - With embedded credit, customers are empowered to buy more, faster. This ultimately increases the platform’s gross merchandise value (GMV) and average order value (AOV).

* **Better CLTV** - Embedded financial services can be tailored for individual merchants. This boosts the platform’s relationship with the merchant and increases customer retention. 

* **Capture larger wallet share** - Get a leg up against competition by offering seamless credit within the platform.

* **Boost activation to acquisition ratio** - Beat the high costs of customer acquisition by offering credit seamlessly.
