## How it works?

** Creating the watchlist** A lender creates a watchlist comprising credit borrowers.

** Analysing the watchlist** CollectX analyzes the watchlisted borrowers for potential red flags, such as account balance lower than the EMI, recent delinquencies, self-transfers when the due date approaches etc.

**Sharing the report** A report on priority order for collections is shared with the lender 7-10 days before the due date.

**Real-time warnings** CollectX triggers real-time warnings whenever borrowers' account balance gets replenished to enable lenders to drive up eNACH re-presentation success rates while minimizing bounce charges.
