## What is BankConnect?

FinBox BankConnect allows users to submit their bank account statements in your app, then processes them and shares the enriched data with lenders. BankConnect makes collaboration between lenders and borrowers easier to make the loan process faster and more intelligent.

## What do you get?

* **Seamless linking of bank accounts** - BankConnect fetches users’ bank account statements via net banking credentials, account aggregators, or manual upload after securing requisite permissions.

* **Data Collector** - BankConnect allows you to analyze the bank statements of users to get alterntae data, which is used for underwriting. This will act as a booster for **thin-file users**, i.e., users with little credit history and **NTC**(New-to-Credit) users.

:::tip User data is safe with FinBox.
We ask users for in-context permission. We do not misuse any of the information.
:::  

* **Inclusive credit landscape** - BankConnect helps lenders extend loans to borrowers that may not have exhaustive paperwork as required in traditional underwriting and loan approval processes. It abstracts the complexity of scanning unstructured data(from bank accounts and third parties) and compiles diverse input documents into enriched, easily consumable PDFs for lenders’ decision systems.

## How it works?

FinBox BankConnect is integrated within the journey itself and provides cross-platform integration. This can be easily integrated with lenders’ mobile application via APIs. Bank Connect SDK gives immense control to customize your user journey. It also features a dashboard that gives insights into application uptime and monitors health status for enhanced customer experience.

* **Uploading bank statements** - This is the first step involved in the BankConnect Integration flow. Bank statements can be uploaded via net banking credentials, account aggregators, or manual upload.

* **Analysing the bank statement** - With automated bank statement analysis, we check users’ credit history, transaction history, and expenses, which gives us an overview of the borrowers’ liabilities and credit utilization capabilities for informed decision making. This helps lenders to classify borrowers accurately as per credit buckets, and all in real-time.
