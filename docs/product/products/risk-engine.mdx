## What is RiskEngine?

With FinBox RiskEngine we make lending precise and profitable with the power of deep learning. We leverage Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Deep Learning to drive Risk Assessment models.

## How it works?

* **Artificial Intelligence Engines** - Artificial Intelligence Engines leverage real-time cash-flow data, identify risky borrowers, and improve collection efficiency by 50%

* **Machine Learning Models** - Our ML models are trained on billions of data points to generate highly precise credit assessment

* **Predictive Analytics** - It automates decision making, predict and prevent delinquencies, and reduce drop-offs by up to 60% on a portfolio

* **Big Data capabilities** - Big Data Capabilities evolve at scale for each contextual use-case and deliver insights that come from deep learning and 16 million new-to-credit (NTC) personas

## Key Features

* Explicit consent-driven permissions before analyzing, storing or gathering  personal, sensitive information of users.
* Flagging risky accounts
* Identifying the reason for delayed payments

Main driving products behind our risk engine are :

* [DeviceConnect](/product/products/device-connect)
* [BankConnect](/product/products/bank-connect)

Lenders can feed alternative data sourced from a borrower's device using [DeviceConnect](/product/products/device-connect), tansactions, cashflows  and other proxies such as their network of contacts or social media activity.

Factoring in inputs such as phonebook contacts, web browser histories and cashflow behaviour, lenders can create a digital footprint that can be monitored in real time and accurately assessed for creditwrothiness. With machine learning-based predictive risk assessment models, this data can help lenders identify a borrower's ability to pay, intent to pay and general financial stability.

With FinBox [CollectX](/product/products/collect-x) we make it easier to collect payments and enforce protocols that preempt defaults. Our algorithms help lenders analyze behavioral patterns, account activity and credit utilization trends to assess if a borrower is likely to default on an upcoming payment. Lenders can then realign their collection resources accordingly, tailoring messages to bororowers based on risk levels, sending reminders on preferred channels and forestalling defaults.

In case a borrower misses a payment, our AI and ML engines can position the account against a holistic financial map. From flagging risky accounts to identifyinng the reason for delayed payments, technology can also help lenders arrive at a mutually beneficial resolution that is more empathetic than predatory collection polocies.
