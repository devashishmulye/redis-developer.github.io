## What is no Code Credit Link?

We provide URL to clients for trial of FinBox credit products. Clients get to run a pilot phase for thier users. If the pilot is successful clients then clients can go ahead with using full version of the product using our SDK.

## What do you get?

### Get to understand need of customers

You can get to know if your users need credit or not. By providing products on credit you can improve your GMV, AOV, Wallet Share, CLTV, and customer acquisition.

### Immediate integration

Integration is done only via an URL provided. No extra coding is required.

### No BankConnect and DeviceConnect

User journey is made much simpler. Users do not need to upload bank statements and share thier device data.

### Can only register with phone and OTP

Users can only register with thier phone no. and OTP. No eKYC is required.
Pilot phase, if succesful then integrate with SDK
