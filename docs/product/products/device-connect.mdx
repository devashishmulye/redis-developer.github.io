## What is DeviceConnect?
FinBox DeviceConnect allows users to share their alternate data, such as non-personal text messages, meta data of contacts, stack of apps installed or geo-tagging. It is an in-device API which can be integrated seamlessly with lenders existing credit decision system and helps screen borrowers with data on their devices, post explicit user permissions.
## What do you get?

Lenders can double their approval rates while maintaining the portfolio quality.
### Inclusive credit landscape
Foster financial inclusion, bringing thin-file borrowers under the ambit of formal credit.
### Bridges the credit gap
With automated and intelligent underwriting, especially for factors such as document verification, lenders can reduce the cost of credit delivery by 50%.
### Prequalify borrowers
With prequalification metrics in place, lenders can now assess thin-file borrowers better with non-conventional parameters such as recent loan enquiries or delinquent activities.
### Equalize Interest Rates
DeviceConnect helps lenders identify fraudulent applications earlier in the loan cycle, therby optimizing the loan funnel and equalizing interest rates, i.e., lower interest rates for good borrowers and higher for high-risk ones.
### Reduce cost of Credit Delivery
With automated and intelligent underwriting, especially for factors such as document verification, lenders can reduce the cost of credit delivery by 50%. DeviceConnect can help lenders approve 25% more loans.
### Enhance Collections
DeviceConnect feeds insights into FinBox CollectX - a risk prioritisation and early warning sysytem - that helps lenders boost collection efficiency by 50%. It also brings delinquency rates down by 30% by helping lenders pivot away from predatory to pre-emptive collection strategies.
## How it works?
Clubbed with credit bureau reports, FinBox DeviceConnect can help lenders increase loan approval rates from 25% to more than 50%.
### Behavioural Data
DeviceConnect tracks loan prodcuts not captured in credit bureau reports, such as pay day loans or credit lines. It creates a holistics financial profile of the borrower based on spending behaviour and overall debt component to help lenders assess better.
### Real-time insights
DeviceConnect leverages the FinBox Inclusion Score(FIS) - an indexing system trained on India’s largest pool of new-to-credit borrowers. FIS, along with device data, garners real-time insights that help in adequately underwriting small-ticket loans.
### New-to-credit(NTC) borrowers
Credit bureaus cover only 50% of borrowers in a digital lending pool. With DeviceConnect lenders can expand this pool with prequalified borrowers with a digital footprint. Clubbed with credit bureau reports, DeviceConnect can help lenders increase loan approval rates from 25% to more than 50%
### DEPA compliance
Intelligence engines are deployed on the user’s device so that data never leaves the device. This helps secure user-sensitive data from misuse and keeps the lender compliant with Data Empowerment and Protection Architecure.
