## What is DeviceConnect?
FinBox DeviceConnect allows users to share their alternate data, such as non-personal text messages, meta data of contacts and installed apps, and geolocation data. It is an in-device API which can be integrated seamlessly with lenders existing credit decision system and helps screen borrowers with data on their devices, post explicit user permissions.

## Why DeviceConnect?

* **Double Approval Rate** - Lenders can double their approval rates while maintaining the portfolio quality.
* **Lower Interest Rates** - DeviceConnect helps lenders identify fraudulent applications earlier in the loan cycle, therby optimizing the loan funnel and equalizing interest rates, i.e., lower interest rates for good borrowers and higher for high-risk ones.
* **Reduce cost of Credit Delivery** - With automated and intelligent underwriting, especially for factors such as document verification, lenders can reduce the cost of credit delivery by 50%. DeviceConnect can help lenders approve 25% more loans.
* **Enhance Collections** - DeviceConnect feeds insights into FinBox [CollectX](/product/products/collect-x) - a collection prioritisation and early warning sysytem - that helps lenders boost collection efficiency by 50%.
* **Boost Financial Inclusion** - Foster financial inclusion, bringing thin-file borrowers under the ambit of formal credit.


## How DeviceConnect works?
* **SDK Integration** - First you need to integrate SDK with your platform.
* **In-context permission** - We ask users for in-context permissions to access their data.
* **Collecting the data** - SDK collects non-personal identifiable data from users' device.
* **Data Enriching and Prediction** - We enrich the collected data and predict users' credit eligibility using our AI models.

## What is alrernative data?

Clubbed with credit bureau reports, FinBox DeviceConnect can help lenders increase loan approval rates from 25% to more than 50%.

* **Behavioural Data** - DeviceConnect tracks loan prodcuts not captured in credit bureau reports, such as pay day loans or credit lines. It creates a holistics financial profile of the borrower based on spending behaviour and overall debt component to help lenders assess better.
* **Real-time insights** - DeviceConnect leverages the FinBox Inclusion Score(FIS) - an indexing system trained on India’s largest pool of new-to-credit borrowers. FIS, along with device data, garners real-time insights that help in adequately underwriting small-ticket loans.
* **New-to-credit(NTC) borrowers** - Credit bureaus cover only 50% of borrowers in a digital lending pool. With DeviceConnect lenders can expand this pool with prequalified borrowers with a digital footprint. Clubbed with credit bureau reports, DeviceConnect can help lenders increase loan approval rates from 25% to more than 50%
* **DEPA compliance** - Intelligence engines are deployed on the user’s device so that data never leaves the device. This helps secure user-sensitive data from misuse and keeps the lender compliant with Data Empowerment and Protection Architecure.
