Account aggregator integration helps in streamlining financial data flow.

For lenders, account aggregators help source data directly from multiple organizations, ensuring a wider variety of parameters are factored in to dilute an instance of fraud. Lenders can directly source data from financial infromation providers(FIPs) with the help of account aggregators. This radically reduces the possibility of data tampering, and also eliminate the need for the borrower to upload documemts.
