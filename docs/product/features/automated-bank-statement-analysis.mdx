Users can upload their bank statements using our product BankConnect. Bank Statements are scanned using OCR(Optical Character Recognition) and then we run our Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence models to analyse the bank statements.

All of this happens and instantly and is integrated within the journey itself.
