import RedisCard from "@site/src/theme/RedisCard";

The user onboarding journey is configurable. If the user has thin data, he can choose to share his bank statement. In case he has enough data, we don't require his Bank Statement. 
Integration is completely flexible. We use [DeviceConnect](/product/products/device-connect) and [BankConnect](/product/products/bank-connect) on the basis of requirement, not necessary using all of them together.

Integration is completely felxible. Anchor apps can change the look and feel of the UI.
