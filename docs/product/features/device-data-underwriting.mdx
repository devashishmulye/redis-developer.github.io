Alternative Data Underwriting is underwriting using alternate data that we collect using our products [DeviceConnect](/product/products/device-connect), [BankConnect](/product/products/bank-connect) and from our partners. 

> Underwriting is a process to determine the credit worthiness of a customer

Our AI engines simplifies credit decisions on a varied set of alternate data(tax invoices, device data, transaction volumes etc.) to assess the credit worthiness.

> For NTC(New to Credit) customers we use alternate data for underwriting.

Through alternative data and analytics, credit providers can assess an MSME's credit worthiness based on the data of their actual business and day-to-day operations. As a result lenders can get a holistic view of the business' credit worthiness, and disburse customized loans with felxible repayment schedules.
