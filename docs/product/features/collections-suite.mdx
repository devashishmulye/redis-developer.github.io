EMI collection can be done by multiple ways. Users can pay their EMIs via

**eNACH and Mandates**

eNACH is activated on the due date. Money will be auto-debitted from users' bank account.


**App Payment(via FinBox payment gateway)**

Users pay via our payment gateway. Money is transferred to FinBoxâ€™s account and then we transfer it to the respective lenders.


** Bank Payment **

A virtual Bank Account is created and the user can transfer money to this account. This is done to avoid the confusion created by multiple repayment deadlines( If the user withdraws money from the credit line on consecutive 5 days, then the repayment deadline will be on consecutive 5 days so to avoid that this virtual bank account is created).
