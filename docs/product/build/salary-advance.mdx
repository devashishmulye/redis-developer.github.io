## Introduction to Salary Advance

Credit aversion and absence of collateral are common reasons why customers shy away from loans. Salary advances can solve both those problems by letting them draw on their salaries in advance.

FinBox salary advances are loans disbursed against the upcoming salaries of employees. The installments are deducted from the salary amount in the subsequent months. These are easier to sanction than other loans, allowing you to disburse loans to larger borrower pools.
