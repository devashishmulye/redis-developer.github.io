##  The challenge

The credit gap for MSMEs in India is $380 Billion.  

MSMEs are already onboarded on digital platforms/commerce portals and generate a lot of data on/off the platforms. This data can be used to underwrite them. Despite being a high-quality borrower pool, they have low access to credit. This is because they lack 
formal data that financial institutions understand. In addition, they often operate informally, require small and flexible credit, which financial instutitions can't offer.


This is the problem that FinBox solves. The key to winning in MSME credit is in-context, tailored credit with partnerships and using alternate data to underwrite borrowers with GST, transactions on the platform, cash flows etc.
