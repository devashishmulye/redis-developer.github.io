## What do we do?


FinBox is a credit infrastructure company that provides fair, formal, and in-context digital credit to 60 million MSMEs in India. We enable any company to become a FinTech company through our Embedded Finance platform which integrates seamlessly within any digital ecosystem. 

We are at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and deep credit expertise. Our product suite includes -  

 - [**Credit Stack**](https://finbox.in/products/embedded-finance/) - We enable any company to launch a digital credit program on their platform by leveraging our end-to-end credit infrastructure.
 - [**Risk Intelligence Stack**](https://finbox.in/products/risk-engine/) - We enable lenders to improve their approval rates and collection percentage by providing risk intelligence 
 - [**Data Stack**](https://finbox.in/products/risk-engine/) - We enable customers connect their data to financial institutions




##  The challenge

The credit gap for MSMEs in India is $380 Billion.  

MSMEs are already onboarded on digital platforms/commerce portals and generate a lot of data on/off the platforms. This data can be used to underwrite them. Despite being a high-quality borrower pool, they have low access to credit. This is because they lack 
formal data that financial institutions understand. In addition, they often operate informally, require small and flexible credit.


This is the problem that FinBox solves. The key to winning in MSME credit is in-context, tailored credit with partnerships and using alternate data to underwrite borrowers with GST, transactions on the platform, cash flows etc.
