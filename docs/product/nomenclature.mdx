## Embedded Finance


**Embedded Finance** - [Embedded Finance](https://finbox.in/blog/what-is-embedded-finance-and-how-it-will-change-fintech-in-india/) or Embedded Banking is the seamless integration of financial services into a traditionally non-financial platform. 
It enables customers to access financial services within the app and in-context. 


**Anchor Platform** - Non-FinTech companies / businesses that own a customer-facing digital platform such as a mobile app, a website, or a desktop application. With their deep understanding of target audience segments, they can offer customized financial solutions to customers, 'embedded' within their platform.

**Lenders or Financial Institutions** - Banks / NBFCs / small finance banks. Their function is two-fold. They provide financial services, and are best positioned to manage regulatory, compliance, and credit risk. They use their network and manpower to manage and service loan requests from the Embedded Finance ecosystem.

**Embedded Finance Infrastructure Company** - FinTech company that creates end-to-end software tools (APIs and SDKs), and connects financial institutions with the digital platform. An SDK (Software Development Kit) enables easy integrations to import functionalities quickly with a mobile / web app. In case of Embedded Finance, the entire loan journey is embedded within the platform / app. It also provides crucial value-added services like loan lifecycle UI, alternate data underwriting engines, customer servicing, and more

## Risk Assessment 


**Credit Policy** - A set of rules decided by a financial institution that measures the creditworthiness of a borrower and determines whether to approve the loan. 

**FLDG** First Loan Default Guatantee is an arrangement in which a third party (such as FinBox) can compensate some of the losses of non performing loans.

**Subvention** - When a digital platform subvents (or absorbs) some of the cost of lending so its customers (borrowers) may get it at a discounted fee.

**Tenure** - Tenure is the duration of repayment of borrowed loan.

**Underwriting** - Underwriting is a process of determining the credit worthiness of a customer. It includes user authentication and risk-assessment.

**Alternate Data Underwriting** -  Underwriting using data other than from credit bureaus. This includes device data, bank statement, GST data, cash-flow data, or any data available with the anchor platform.

**Adaptive Journey** - Borrowers are onboarded as per their creditworthiness. Premium borrowers will be onboarded in fewer steps. Thin-file customers will have the option to share their data through various ways to acquire the loan.
