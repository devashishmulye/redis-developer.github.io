## Embedded Finance


**Embedded Finance** - [Embedded Finance](https://finbox.in/blog/what-is-embedded-finance-and-how-it-will-change-fintech-in-india/) is the seamless integration of financial services into a traditionally non-financial platform. 
It enables customers of existing digital platforms (Anchor platforms) to access financial services within the app and in-context. 


**Anchor Platform** - Non-FinTech companies / businesses that own a customer-facing digital platform such as a mobile app, a website, or a desktop application. With their deep understanding of target audience segments, they can offer customized financial solutions to customers, 'embedded' within their platform.

**Lenders or Financial Institutions** - Banks / NBFCs / small finance banks. Their function is two-fold. They provide financial services, and are best positioned to manage regulatory, compliance, and credit risk. They use their network and manpower to manage and service loan requests from the Embedded Finance ecosystem.

## Risk Assessment 


**Credit Policy** - A set of rules decided by a financial institution that measures the creditworthiness of a borrower and determines whether to approve the loan. 

**FLDG - First Loan Default Guatantee** - FLDG is an arrangement in which a third party (such as FinBox) can compensate some of the losses of non performing loans and take some risk off from the financial institution financing the loan.

**Subvention** - When a digital platform subvents (or absorbs) some of the cost of lending so its customers (borrowers) may get it at a discounted fee.

**Underwriting** - Underwriting is a process of determining the credit worthiness of a customer. It includes user authentication and risk-assessment.

**Traditional Underwriting** - Traditional underwriting refers to how financial institutions have been assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers - with credit history data from credit bureaus.
