NTC(New-to-credit) Customers are the customers who have no credit history. They are new to borrowing.

For NTC customers we use alternate data for underwriting.

> Underwriting is a process to determine the credit worthiness of a customer

We get alternate data using [DeviceConnect](/products/device-connect), [BankConnect](/products/bank-connect) and from our partners.
Our Alternative data-based underwriting scorecards from mobile device data enable us to approve New-to-Credit customers.
