The user onboarding journey is adaptive. If the user has thin data, he can choose to share his bank statement. In case he has enough data, we don't require his Bank Statement. 
Integration is completely flexible. We use [DeviceConnect](/products/device-connect) and [BankConnect](/products/bank-connect) on the basis of requirement, not necessary using all of them together.

:::note We only collect as much as we need.
