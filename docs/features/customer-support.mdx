FinBox Customer support is available to users throughout the user journey, from loan application to repayment. Our customer support identifies the needs of customers, resolve issues and provide solutions. They assist customers if they are facing any issues while applying for loan and also they send timely reminders for repayment of EMIs.

We keep track of all the customers on our **Customer Dashboard**. From dashboard we can see which customer is in which part of the journey and we reach out to them accordingly.

:::note We also provide customers the facility of **Assisted Journey**. Data required for loan application is autofilled using the data shared by Partner. We send link to users for completing the eKYC and eSigning the agreement.
